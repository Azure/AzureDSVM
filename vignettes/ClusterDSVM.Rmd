title = "Using Azure Data Science Resources: Cluster Linux DSVM Quick Start"

# Use Case

A cluster of Linux Data Science Virtual Machines (DSVMs) is deployed
and a remote command is executed across each to demonstrate they
exists. Code is included but not run to then delete the resource group
if the resources are no longer required. Once deleted consumption will
cease.

This script is best run interactively to review its operation and to
ensure that the interaction with Azure completes.

# Setup

To get started load our Azure credentials as well as the user's ssh
public key. This information has been saved into a file with the name
<USER>_credentials.R where <USER> is your username.

```{r setup}
# Load the required subscription resources: TID, CID, and KEY.
# Also includes the ssh PUBKEY for the user.

USER <- Sys.getenv("USER")

source(paste0(USER, "_credentials.R"))
```

```{r packages}
# Load the required packages.

library(AzureSMR)    # Support for managing Azure resources.
library(AzureDSR)    # Further support for the Data Scientist.
library(magrittr)    
library(dplyr)
library(rattle)      # Use weatherAUS as a "large" dataset.
```

```{r tuning}
# Parameters for this script: the name for the new resource group and
# its location across the Azure cloud. The resource name is used to
# name the resource group that we will create transiently for the
# purposes of this script.

RG    <- "my_dsvm_rg_sea"  # Will be created if not already exist then kill.
LOC   <- "southeastasia"   # Where the resource group (resources) will be hosted.

# Create names for the VMs.

COUNT <- 5                 # Number of VMs to deploy.
BASE  <- 
  runif(4, 1, 26) %>%
  round() %>%
  letters[.] %>%
  paste(collapse="")
LDSVM <- paste0("ldsvm", BASE, sprintf("%03d", 1:COUNT)) %T>% print()
```

```{r connect}
# Connect to the Azure subscription and use this as the context for
# our activities.

context <- createAzureContext(tenantID=TID, clientID=CID, authKey=KEY)

# Check if the resource group already exists. Take note this script
# will not remove the resource group if it pre-existed.

context %>%
  azureListRG() %>%
  filter(name == RG) %>%
  select(name, location) %T>%
  print() %>%
  nrow() %>%
  equals(0) %>%
  not() %T>%
  print() ->
rg_pre_exists
```
# Creation

Create the resource group within which all resources we create will be
grouped.

```{r create resource group}
if (! rg_pre_exists)
{
  # Create a new resource group into which we create the VMs and
  # related resources. Resource group name is RG. 
  
  # Note that to create a new resource group one needs to add access
  # control of Active Directory application at subscription level.

  azureCreateResourceGroup(context, RG, LOC)

}
```

Create the actual Linux DSVM cluser with public-key based
authentication method. Name, username, and size can also be
configured.

```{r deploy}
# Deploy the required Linux DSVM - generally 4 minutes each. All but
# the last will be deployed asynchronously whilst the last is deployed
# synchronously so that we wait for it and hopefully the others.

for (vm in LDSVM)
{
  deployDSVM(context, 
             resource.group=RG,
             location=LOC,
             name=vm,
             username=USER,
             size="Standard_DS1_v2",
             os="Linux",
             authen="Key",
             pubkey=PUBKEY,
             mode=ifelse(vm==tail(LDSVM, 1), "Sync", "ASync"))
}
    
for (vm in LDSVM)
{
  cat(vm, "\n")
  
  operateDSVM(context, RG, vm, operation="Check")
  
  # Send a simple system() command across to the new server to test
  # its existence. Expect a single line with an indication of how long
  # the server has been up and running.
  
  cmd <- paste("ssh -q",
               "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no",
               "-o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null\\\n   ",
               paste0(vm, ".", LOC, ".cloudapp.azure.com"),
               "uptime") %T>%
    {cat(., "\n")}
  cmd
  system(cmd)
  cat("\n")
}
```

# Optional Delete

```{r optionally delete resource group}
# Delete the resource group now if required. By default we don't.
# Deletion seems to take 10 minutes or more.

if (FALSE)
  azureDeleteResourceGroup(context, RG)
```

Once deleted we are consuming no more.
